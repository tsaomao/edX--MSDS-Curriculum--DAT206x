- Classic analysis demo
	- Hidden tabs in xlsx demo show data that charts are based on
	- Charts and pivots require all data to exist in single range, as
	  opposed to pivoting across multiple sheets/ranges.
	- In example spreadsheet, data broght to single range with VLOOKUP() formulas and references
	- Demo uses [@Table] format to reference named Tables in Excel (newer feature)
	- Limitations to classic Excel driven analysis:
		- VLOOKUPs can get very slow. 
		- VLOOKUPs are difficult to maintain/error prone.
		- No good tools/operations to shape and clean data. Every option burdensome.
			- Copy/paste
			- Macros
			- Typing
		- Scale is poor
			- Excel maxes out at 1,000,000 rows
			- VLOOKUPs at that scale are extremely slow to recalculate
		- Some modern data sources not accessible to native Excel
	- New features:
		- Pivot tables from multiple ranges
		- Repeatable, button driven data cleaning processes
		- Scale: 10s of millions of rows (with great performance)
		- Create business logic
		- Complex business logic in an extended language that still shares many characteristics
		  of classic Excel syntax and behavior
		- Data, language extensions, query language
