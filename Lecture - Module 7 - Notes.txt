- 	Visualizing
	- Can create Pivot Charts without Pivot Tables (new feature 2013)
	- For visual cleanliness, consider turning off spreadsheet features like gridlines in dashboards
	- Also consider hiding tables so they don't clutter the Pivot field selection window
	- 
	
- Slicers
	- If you create a slicer in one pivotchart, you have to go to options for slicer, then Report Connections and 
	  then select other charts if you want to tie it to other charts
		- Argues for naming charts so you can see non-default names in this selector
	- May show more options than there is data (greyed out) but you can also hide these excess options
	- Can be connected to Pivot Charts and Pivot Tables on other worksheets
	
	
- Data hierarchies
	- Can be defined in Data Model
	- Hierarchy:
		- Collection of fields (e.g. Year, Month, Day) that go together
	- If there's a specific drilldown path for any task or analysis that is repetitive, consider a hierarchy
	
- Customizing Pivot Tables
	- Connect existing slicer to Pivot Table:
		- Either
			- Edit Connections in Slicer options
			OR
			- In Analyze button for Table, use Filter Connections
	
- Cube Functions
	- Create Pivot Table
	- From Analyze ribbon within Pivot Table, in Calculation chunk, use OLAP Tools -> Convert to Formulas
		- This changes the Pivot Table so that each cell is now a cube function
		- Slicer is still connected to these formulas
	- CUBESET function starts with Connection
		- Then you can drill down through data model with autofill
		- .children function can be inserted manually 
			- This is an MDX function
				- MDX is the syntax/language of OLAP data cubes
		- Cell with CUBESET function now contains data which you can reference with CUBERANKEDMEMBER and CUBEMEMBER functions
		- CUBEVALUE can reference context values (you specify cell locations) and slicers (by name)
		- Far more flexible in terms of cell locations and narrowed behavior than Pivot Tables
		- You should understand MDX to help understand how this feature set works
		- Also can integrate data from multiple tables into a single report
		
Cube-based charting:
	- Treemap and Sunburst charts available only in 2016
	- Show results based on area/value
