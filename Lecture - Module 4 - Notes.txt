- Importing Data from a Database
	- Use credentials from Windows or type in SQL database user credentials
	- After negotiating authentication, move on to view databases and table the credentials have access to, and import to PowerQuery
	- In PowerQuery, you want to interrelate different tables. To do that in PQ, create unique identifiers by merging uniquely
	  identifying information in two related tables, e.g. Country and Zipcode
	- In PQ, you can also apply filters to typed data, e.g. a date filter to accept only data with dates after a certain date
	- Import first, then go into data model to establish relationships
	- In Data Model, view in Diagram view, and click and drag to create relationships between identity fields
- PowerQuery/Data Model
	- You can create a Date Table within PowerQuery in Excel 2016 (e.g. a Calendar table)
		- Design Ribbon -> Calendars chunk -> Date Table
	- In prior versions, you can create a table within Excel and then import into the Data Model
	- Be sure to check relationships after creating the new table
- Import folder of CSVs
	- Imports as single table
	- Still requires cleanup
	- Define foreign key (e.g. Location = Merge of Country and Postal Code)
	- Load to Connection but not to Data Model
	- Append Query in PowerQuery used to import the CSVs at the end of the rest of the Sales table already imported from the Database
	- Can wipe out existing table relationships in Data Model
		- Autodetect relationships can restore these relationships
		- May get phased out of future Excel verions
