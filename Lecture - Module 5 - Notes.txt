- Creating and Formatting Measures
	- Measures can be created in Data Model
	- Measures can also be created from a Pivot Chart (will show later)
	- SUMX is a DAX function that can do the Revenue generation and Sum all at once
		- First argument is table name
		- Second is operation/expression
	- In the Pivot Chart's field display, you can right-click and edit or delete the measure
	- You can also right-click a Table and add a measure
	- CALCULATE:
		- Mother of all functions in DAX
	- ALL:
		- Can bypass context and provide the sum of all rows even in a row/slicer/field context within a pivot or formula
		  for specified fields in CALCULATE call
		- Other fields (not specified) can still affect the Measure's context
	- Using example ALL calculation in other formulas, not necc'ly in the Pivot, but can add to the pivot to make sure it
	  is actually defying the context.
	- Math:
		- Better to use DAX function DIVIDE than / operator.
			- DIVIDE() is divide-by-zero safe

- Advanced DAX
	- Make business logic using DAX
	- Chart in lecture spreadsheet:
		- Left chart not connected to slicer
			- Will connect/demo later
		- Left chart +/- will drill down into monthwise data
