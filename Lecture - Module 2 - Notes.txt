- The Excel Data Model

- Introducted in Excel 2010 as an add-on
- Integrated into Excel 2013 and above
- Demo
	- Data in demo spreadsheet viewable under Data -> Manage Data Model
	- Data View views as spreadsheet-like per table
	- Diagram View views data-relation-oriented schema like a database diagram
	- You can add calculated columns to Data Model with Excel Table syntax
	- Added values for one row are calculated real time for entire table in data model
	- If you add a Pivot Table to the workbook, Excel automatically selects the data model if populated
	- Drill down in fields dialog with triangle control from list of tables to fields within
	- Can select fields from different (related) tables
	- Right click a field to create a slicer
	
- Basic DAX
	- Some Pivot table setup operations are possible with the data model which are not possible with
	  native/legacy Excel
		- Example: 
			- Drag customer Key from FactInternetSales to Values
			- Change default SUM aggregation to Distinct Count (Under Value Field Settings in Right-Click
			  Menu)
			- Shows distinct customers for each combination
			- This is not really possible to do with classic features
			- Also note performance is VERY QUICK
	- More Data Model Tweaks:
		- Apply custom column format e.g. Currency
		- Examine formula used for Revenue column created in previous demo
			- Written in DAX language
			- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):
				- Can be very sophisticated
				- Can be used in Calculated Columns
				- Can be used for Measures
			- Measures:
				- Measures are created in the rows in the data model below the Data
				  (Where the totals would be in a Table in Excel)
				- Syntax: Name:=Formula
				- E.g.: TotalRev:=sum(FactInternetSales[Revenue])
				- Can format a Measure to, e.g., a Currency
				- These are explicit Meausres
				- Examples of implicit Measures are aggregates created by selecting columns for the 
				  Values in a Pivot
				- Explicit Measures show up as fields in a Pivot's setup
				- When they show up in a pivot chart, note that each measure is recalculated in the pivot
				  with the right calculation context
			- Calculated Columns:
				- Do calculated columns have the same filter context? No.
				- Calculated columns' DAX context are the rows they live in.
					- They cannot know to what purposes they'll be put for the later Pivots
				- Can use columns in the row
				- Can also use columns in related tables (RELATED() function)
